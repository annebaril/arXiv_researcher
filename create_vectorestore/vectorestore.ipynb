To construct\\nsuch associations, we propose a contrastive learning approach that trains the\\nnetwork to differentiate the combination of prompts and latent codes. Extensive\\nevaluations of human faces with a single subject show that CoCoIns performs\\ncomparably to existing methods while maintaining higher flexibility.

The\\nquantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are\\nless understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have\\nbeen separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a\\nunified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the\\nrealizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility\\nedges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct\\nphases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we\\nshow that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry\\npreserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a\\ncriteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with\\nmobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical\\nstates that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized\\nincommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a\\nnovel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless\\nsystems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact\\nsolvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we\\nidentify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system\\nhosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single\\nmodel that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization.\\nFinally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using\\nquasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.\",\n",

The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task\\ninto separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or\\nmultiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from\\nthe provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of\\nreasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not\\ntypically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for\\nplanning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,\\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\\npolicy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of\\nvalidating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms\\nfor each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a\\nvariety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the\\nperformance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show\\nthat no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all\\ntested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current\\nfrontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason\\nabout planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with\\nsolving these reasoning tasks. ACPBench Hard collection is available at the\\nfollowing link: https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench',\n",

       "  'résumé': \"Supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies gain mass through\\naccretion disks. Models predict that quasi-spherical winds, expelled by the\\nblack hole during active accretion phases, have a key role in shaping galaxy\\nevolution by regulating star formation, the distribution of metals over\\nkiloparsec scales, and by sweeping ambient gas to the outskirts and beyond of\\ngalaxies. Nonetheless, the mechanism driving these outflows and the amount of\\nenergy exchanged between the wind and the galaxy's interstellar medium remain\\nunclear. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the kinematical properties of\\nwinds in a sample of nearby active galaxies using the novel kinematic tool\\nMOKA3D, which takes into account the clumpy nature of the ISM. We find\\nremarkable similarities among the properties of the outflows in all the\\ngalaxies examined. In particular, we provide the first evidence that outflows\\nexhibit a regular trend in radial velocity, initially constant or slightly\\ndecreasing, followed by rapid acceleration starting at approximately 1 kpc from\\nthe nucleus, despite the seemingly complex kinematics observed. The observed\\nbehavior aligns with our current theoretical understanding of Active Galactic\\nNuclei outflows, where a momentum-driven phase transitions to an\\nenergy-conserving phase just beyond approximately 1 kpc. The constant velocity\\nof the momentum-driven wind is then rapidly accelerated following the\\ninefficient Compton cooling of post-shock material and the transition to energy\\nconservation. The measured radial terminal velocities of the outflows are\\nalways larger than the escape velocities from the host galaxies, confirming the\\nkey role of outflows in shaping the galaxy properties and evolution, as a\\nmanifestation of AGN feedback. Our results, only made possible by our novel\\nkinematic analysis tool, are crucial to understand the origin and the powering\\nmechanism of these winds.\",\n",

Moreover, under\\nreasonable assumptions on the complexity of Hamiltonian simulation,\\n$\\\\widetilde{\\\\Omega}(d/\\\\epsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Thus, QHD does not\\noffer a speedup over classical zeroth order methods with exact oracles.\\nHowever, we demonstrate that the QHD algorithm tolerates\\n$\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathcal{O}}(\\\\epsilon^3/d^{1.5}G^2 R^2)$ noise in function\\nevaluation. We show that QHD offers a super-quadratic query advantage over all\\nknown classical algorithms tolerating this level of evaluation noise in the\\nhigh-dimension regime. Additionally, we design a quantum algorithm for\\nstochastic convex optimization that provides a super-quadratic speedup over all\\nknown classical algorithms in the high-dimension regime. To our knowledge,\\nthese results represent the first rigorous quantum speedups for convex\\noptimization achieved through a dynamical algorithm.',\n",

       "  'résumé': 'To reduce the human intervention in the preference measure process,this\\narticle proposes a preference collaborative measure framework based on an\\nupdated belief system,which is also capable of improving the accuracy and\\nefficiency of preferen-ce measure algorithms.Firstly,the distance of rules and\\nthe average internal distance of rulesets are proposed for specifying the\\nrelationship between the rules.For discovering the most representative\\npreferences that are common in all users,namely common preference,a algorithm\\nbased on average internal distance of ruleset,PRA algorithm,is proposed,which\\naims to finish the discoveryprocess with minimum information loss\\nrate.Furthermore,the concept of Common belief is proposed to update the belief\\nsystem,and the common preferences are the evidences of updated belief\\nsystem.Then,under the belief system,the proposed belief degree and deviation\\ndegree are used to determine whether a rule confirms the belief system or not\\nand classify the preference rules into two kinds(generalized or\\npersonalized),and eventually filters out Top-K interesting rules relying on\\nbelief degree and deviation degree.Based on above,a scalable interestingness\\ncalculation framework that can apply various formulas is proposed for\\naccurately calculating interestingness in different conditions.At last,IMCos\\nalgorithm and IMCov algorithm are proposed as exemplars to verify the accuracy\\nand efficiency of the framework by using weighted cosine similarity and\\ncorrelation coefficients as belief degree.In experiments,the proposed\\nalgorithms are compared to two state-of-the-art algorithms and the results show\\nthat IMCos and IMCov outperform than the other two in most aspects.',\n",

       "  'résumé': 'We consider the task of privately obtaining prediction error guarantees in\\nordinary least-squares regression problems with Gaussian covariates (with\\nunknown covariance structure). We provide the first sample-optimal polynomial\\ntime algorithm for this task under both pure and approximate differential\\nprivacy. We show that any improvement to the sample complexity of our algorithm\\nwould violate either statistical-query or information-theoretic lower bounds.\\nAdditionally, our algorithm is robust to a small fraction of arbitrary outliers\\nand achieves optimal error rates as a function of the fraction of outliers. In\\ncontrast, all prior efficient algorithms either incurred sample complexities\\nwith sub-optimal dimension dependence, scaling with the condition number of the\\ncovariates, or obtained a polynomially worse dependence on the privacy\\nparameters.\\n  Our technical contributions are two-fold: first, we leverage resilience\\nguarantees of Gaussians within the sum-of-squares framework. As a consequence,\\nwe obtain efficient sum-of-squares algorithms for regression with optimal\\nrobustness rates and sample complexity. Second, we generalize the recent\\nrobustness-to-privacy framework [HKMN23, (arXiv:2212.05015)] to account for the\\ngeometry induced by the covariance of the input samples. This framework\\ncrucially relies on the robust estimators to be sum-of-squares algorithms, and\\ncombining the two steps yields a sample-optimal private regression algorithm.\\nWe believe our techniques are of independent interest, and we demonstrate this\\nby obtaining an efficient algorithm for covariance-aware mean estimation, with\\nan optimal dependence on the privacy parameters.',\n",
